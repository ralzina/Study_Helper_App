            <div class="technique-card-description">
                The Feynman Technique is a study method designed to deepen understanding by teaching 
                a concept in simple terms. It involves breaking down complex ideas into plain language, 
                identifying gaps in knowledge, and refining explanations.

                <br><br>

                The technique is attributed to physicist Richard Feynman, who was known for his ability 
                to explain complex scientific concepts clearly. He developed this method as part of his 
                learning process to ensure he fully understood topics he studied or taught.

                    <li>Explain the concept you want to learn as if you were teaching it to a 12-year-old. Write this 
                        on the explanation text box. Use plain, simple language and avoid jargon, focusing on clarity.

                    <li>While explaining, identify areas where you struggle to simplify, are unsure of the details,
                         or realize you don't fully understand the concept. Write down these things in the knowledge gaps
                          text box.</li><br>
                    <li>Go back to the source material and research the gaps you identified. Go to your explanation text box and
                         refine it by filling in the gaps you determined until it's effective.

                    <li>Repeat the process until you can explain the concept clearly and confidently and export your text to a text file through the export button.
