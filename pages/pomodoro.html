            <div class="technique-card-description">
                The Pomodoro Technique is a time management strategy designed to 
                improve focus and productivity by dividing work into intervals called "Pomodoros." 
                Each Pomodoro lasts 25 minutes, followed by a short break. After completing a set 
                number of intervals, you take a longer break. Developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 
                late 1980s, it is named after the tomato-shaped timer he used while studying.

                <ul>
                    <li>Set a Timer: Set a timer for 25 minutes, the duration of one Pomodoro. You can edit this time by clicking on the textboxes.
                         You can edit the minutes and seconds of both your study time and break time. You can also select what mode you want, so if you select 
                         study mode, the timer will count your study time, if you set break mode, it will count your break time.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Work Intensely: Focus entirely on the task until the timer rings. Avoid distractions and interruptions. When the timer starts running, the input boxes for minutes and seconds as well as the mode selector are all disabled. In the case that you have an unexpected reason
                         to stop studying but don't want the timer to keep running, you can click pause to pause the timer and click start when you're ready to keep studying or relaxing
                          if you're on break time. In the case that you want to reset your timer becasue you have to leave or want to change the time,  you can click reset and this button will reactivate the mode and the 
                          input boxes of the minutes and seconds for study and break.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Take a Short Break: After 25 minutes, or whatever time you selected to study, take your preferred break to relax. The mode selector will automatically shift between study and break mode when the timer finishes. You can also edit this time</li><br>
                    <li>Repeat: Complete 4 Pomodoros, then take a longer break of 15-30 minutes.</li>
