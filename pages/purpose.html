                    <h1>Why Study Methods Matter</h1>
                    <p>
                        Studying effectively is not just about spending hours with books or notes; it's about using the right techniques to retain information and stay motivated. 
                        Research shows that applying proven study methods can significantly boost learning outcomes and make the process more efficient.
                        However, many of us overlook or are unaware of these methods, relying on less effective strategies that lead to frustration and burnout.
